# Code Cadets Extension - Discoboard Lab 4 Template

This is the lab 4 template for writing pure-asm code programs for your discoboard. It assumes you're using VSCode and have set things up according to the software setup instructions.

Open the root folder, start writing code in `src/main.S` and off you go!
